Fitting Auto-Regressive process to simulated calcium signals - Pseudoinverse
spikes times and neuron ids imported from simulated brunel network, brunel_network.ipynb low-pass filtering of these spikes has been considered as simulated calcium signals. Fitting an Auto-regressive process to these signals will end up to a system of least squares which can be solved by pseudo-inverse of signals.

Different analysis has been presented which all will have their own explanations.

Due to the restrictions of memory codes have been written in separate block in order to have more control on the process of running. There shall be some hypothesis and techniques which can solve these restriction and the whole process could be less expenssive.

For an end-to-end version, everthing including saving, naming and loading the files as well as analysis for different parameters shall get done systematically.

As the process of fitting takes long, the whole analysis can't be systematic. So, in order to plot figures the results has been recorded one by one in another file then plots are made. Further information will be found in the read me.
